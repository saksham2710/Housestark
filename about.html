        <h2>About House Stark</h2>
        <p> House Stark is the former ruling house the North. Their seat was Winterfell. Their sigil is a grey direwolf on a field of white, and their words are "Winter Is Coming." 
            The Starks are descended from Bran the Builder, a legendary figure from the Age of Heroes, thousands of years in the past, who built Winterfell and the Wall. They were Kings in the North until Torrhen Stark submitted to Aegon the Conqueror at the end of the War of Conquest. From that time until the Red Wedding, the Starks held the North for the Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men as Lords of Winterfell, Lords Paramount of the North, and Wardens of the North.</p>
