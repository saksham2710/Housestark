            <h2>House Stark Sigil</h2>
            <p> Their sigil is a grey direwolf on a field of white, and their words are "Winter Is Coming." What does the Stark sigil mean?
                House Stark sigil
                
                A direwolf is used as the symbol for the House Stark sygil, which is probably the most well-known to Game of Thrones fans. It is the animal that is associated with the Northern house, and this was established back in the first season when direwolf pups were discovered by the Stark family.
